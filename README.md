authorly
========

HTML version of Authorly.com

Structure
---------
css, js – self-explanatory; all JavaScript is based on jQuery
img – images used in css
images –  images used in content with img tag (icons, images in "features", etc)
uploads – all book covers

Submit buttons
--------------
All submit buttons are disabled (prev.default) so if you don't want to use my poor man's validator, remove it along with the function.

Changing the video
------------------
To change the video, replace the URL in line 9 of functions.js.

Notes
------
Table in About us, showing "Made by Authorly" books – I couldn't find any other solution, looks okay, but in html it's a horror
CSS – very long and messy :/
Most of the pages are validated : there are some errors with meta tags, no big deal

Any questions? Call, write, yell, shout :)
Good night!
