			Authorly Privacy Policy
		</h1>
		<p class="upDate">
			Last Update: February 5, 2013
		</p>
		<p>
			This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your personal information. You accept this Privacy Policy when you sign up for or use our mobile applications, services or any other features, technologies or functionalities offered by us on our website, applications or through any other means (collectively the “Authorly Services”). We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. In addition, if the revised version includes a substantial change, we will provide you with 30 days’ prior notice by posting notice of the change.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How we collect information about you
		</h2>
		<p>
		When you visit the Authorly website (www.authorly.com or www.author.ly) or use the Authorly Services or applications, we collect information sent to us by your computer, mobile phone or other access device. This information may include your IP address, device information including but not limited to identifier, name and type, operating system, location, mobile network information and standard web log information, such as your browser type, traffic to and from our site and the pages you accessed on our website. If you open an account or use the Authorly Services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Contact information – your name, address, phone, email and other similar information.
			</li>
			<li>
				Financial information – the Account Information, billing & credit charges, or any other financial data you give us when you use the Authorly Services.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Before permitting you to use the Authorly Services, we may require you to provide additional information we can use to verify your identity or address or manage risk, such as your date of birth, social security number or other information. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services.
		</p>
		<p>
		When you use the Authorly Services, we collect information about your transactions and your other activities on our website, application or when using the Authorly Services and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes. You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Authorly account and authorizing Authorly to have access to this information, you agree that Authorly may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In order to help protect you from fraud and misuse of your personal information, we may collect information about your use and interaction with our website, application or the Authorly Services. For example, we may evaluate your computer, mobile phone or other access device to identify any malicious software or activity that may affect the availability of the Authorly Services.
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways such as contacts with our customer support team or results when you respond to a survey and from interactions with members of the Authorly corporate family, and from other companies.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How we use cookies
		</h2>
		<p>
		When you access our website or content or use our application or the Authorly Services, we or companies we work with, may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on your computer or other device. We use these technologies to recognize you as a Authorly customer, customize the Authorly Services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness, collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud and promote trust and safety.
		We use both session and persistent cookies when you access our website or content. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire.
		</p>
		<p>
		You may encounter Authorly cookies or pixel tags on websites that we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie or pixel tag placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third parties may place cookies or pixel tags that are not subject to our control and the Authorly Privacy Policy does not cover their use.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How we protect and store personal information
		</h2>
		<p>
		Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person.
		</p>
		<p>
		We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How we use the personal information we collect

In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access the Authorly Services. We work with third parties, to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using Authorly. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that third party. We use this information to confirm that you are an Authorly customer and that Authorly can be enabled, or where a payment is sent to you to send you notification that you have received a payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a Authorly client with a third party, we will do so. Please note that our partners and other companies may have their own privacy policies, and Authorly may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.
		</p>
		<h2>

		</h2>
		<p>
		We may share your personal information with:
		</p>
		<ul>

			</li>
			<li>
				Our network of partners,affiliates,and contractors, in order to fulfill Authorly Services.
			</li>

			</li>
			<li>
				Banking partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants (in the event that you meet their criteria which includes having Authorly close your Authorly Account due to your breach of the Authorly User Agreement).
			</li>
			<li>
				Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)
			</li>
			<li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when:
				<ul>
					<li>we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure</li>
					<li>we need to do so to comply with law or credit card rules</li>
					<li>we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
			</li>

		</p>
		<h2>
		  How you can restrict Authorly from sharing your personal information
		</h2>
		<p>
		Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances. However, these laws also state that you cannot restrict other types of sharing.

		</p>
		<p>
		If you do not want Authorly to share your personal information with Authorly companies for the purpose of marketing their products or with other financial institutions for the purpose of marketing our jointly offered products to you, please contact us to unsubscribe from these options. Please email <a href="mailto:info@authorly.com">info@Authorly.com</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>
		  How you can access or change your personal information
		</h2>
		<p>
		Please email us if you would like to close your Authorly account, at info@authorly.com. If you close your Authorly account, we will mark your account in our database as “Closed,” but will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
