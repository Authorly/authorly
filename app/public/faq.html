			<h2>Creating a storybook app</h2>
			<h3>What is Authorly?</h3>
			<p>
				Authorly is a powerful Do-It-Yourself digital publishing platform that enables writers to create interactive storybooks for iOS and Android. Using an intuitive web interface, authors can easily build beautiful mobile books that children of all ages will enjoy.
			</p>
			<h3>Do I have to be a published author to use Authorly?</h3>
			<p>
				Nope! Authorly welcomes anyone with a great illustrated story--whether self-published, traditionally published, or not (yet) published. You just need the rights to publish the story in an electronic format. <a href="http://freelancewrite.about.com/od/legalissues/a/rights.htm">Read more about the different types of publishing rights.</a>
			</p>
			<h3>What kinds of books can I create with Authorly?</h3>
			<p>
				Children's storybooks, comic books, graphic novels, etc. Authorly plays nice with any illustrated story.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I use this to make an app from any story I want?</h3>
			<p>
				The short answer: no. The long answer: you can use Authorly to make an app out of any story, as long as (1) you own electronic publishing rights for it and (2) the story abides by <a href="/tos.html">our Terms of Service</a> and the Terms of Service of each market you plan to use to promote your app.
			</p>
			<h3>Which computer, software, other hardware, etc. do I need to make an Authorly app?</h3>
			<p>
				Short answer: Authorly is device-independent and doesn't require special hardware or software.
			</p>
			<p>
				Long answer: Authorly doesn't have exact technical restrictions, but we recommend the following:
			</p>
			<p>
				Computer in good condition (desktop, laptop, or netbook)<br />
				Modern operating system (Windows XP, 7, 8; Mac OSX Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion; any Linux distribution released in the last five years)<br />
				Modern browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari)<br />
				Broadband Internet access
			</p>
			<h3>What kind of multimedia can I use in my app?</h3>
			<p>
				You can add music, videos, and animations to your app (again, provided that you own the rights to use them in a commercial work).
			</p>
			<h3>Who reads books on an electronic device?</h3>
			<p>
				Plenty of people read electronic books! Devices like the Kindle Fire and iPad make it easy for children to enjoy interactive storybooks and for adults and teenagers to carry around (the equivalent of) stacks of comic books or graphic novels. Plus, on the whole, e-book readers buy and read more books than people who only read paper books. (Shocking, we know.) <a href="http://pinterest.com/bwmbooks/ebook-ereader-stats-and-charts/">Check out the charts.</a>
			</p>
			<h3>Does Authorly create books for "e-readers" (Amazon Kindle, Barnes &amp; Noble Nook, Sony Reader, Kobo, etc.)?</h3>
			<p>
				Storybooks just aren't the same without pictures. So, no, Authorly doesn't build static books for e-readers with an electronic paper display. But if you're looking to make this kind of ebook, you're in luck--they're <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/29/how-to-make-an-ebook/">easy and cheap</a> to make yourself.
			</p>
			<p>
				(Authorly's interactive apps will work on tablet-like e-reader devices. The Kindle Fire is currently supported, and we're working quickly to support the Nook Color also.)
			</p>
			<h3>Is Authorly one of those "cookie cutter" app builders? I want my app to look unique, not like a template.</h3>
			<p>
				Nope! No templates, no cookie cutters. Authorly gives you free rein over every aspect of your book, from the sounds and animations to the juxtaposition of words and pictures--really, everything. Your app will look as unique as its printed predecessor!

			<h2>Pricing and ownership</h2>
			<h3>Who owns my storybook app?</h3>
			<p>
				You do. You retain your rights to both the story and the app and keep 100% of the revenue you make from selling the app.
			</p>
			<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
			<p>
				Authorly is currently free for beta users. In the future, we'll offer monthly and annual paid plans for authors who wish to export their work to app markets.
			</p>
			<h3>Do I have to sign a long-term contract?</h3>
			<p>
				No. You may cancel your Authorly account at any time. Any apps you've published through Authorly belong to you and will therefore continue to appear in your chosen app markets, but will no longer be editable through Authorly. Unpublished apps (i.e., apps built in Authorly that you haven't submitted to app markets) belong to Authorly and will be discontinued when you cancel your account.

		<article class="faq ornament_ending">
			<h2>Submitting to app markets</h2>
			<h3>Where will my readers find my storybook app?</h3>
			<p>
				In the app markets you've selected. When you're done building your app inside of the Authorly web interface, you can choose to submit it to any of the following: Google Play (for Android phones and tablets), the Kindle Fire Store (for Kindle Fires), and the App Store (for iPhones, iPads, and iPods).
			</p>
			<h3>Is my storybook app guaranteed to make it into an app market?</h3>
			<p>
				No. We do our best to ensure that your app meets all market standards, but ultimately Google, Apple, and Amazon are the gatekeepers. If for some reason a market rejects your app, don't fret! We'll help you with revising and resubmitting your app.
			</p>
			<h3>Who submits my storybook app to the App Store, the Kindle Fire Store, Google Play, etc.?</h3>
			<p>
				The Authorly team submits your app to the markets of your choice. However, you're the primary contact and owner of the account behind the app submission, so we need a few things from you to get started.
			</p>
			<h3>What do I need to submit my app to the App Store?</h3>
			<p>
				Enroll in the iOS Developer Program (see links below). This allows you to become the primary contact for Apple and legally market and own your app. It also ensures that the app is released under your name.<br />
				<a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/start/standard/">Enroll in the iOS Developer Program</a><br />
				<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Flibrary%2Fios%2F%23documentation%2FToolsLanguages%2FConceptual%2FYourFirstAppStoreSubmission%2FEnrollintheiOSDeveloperProgram%2FEnrollintheiOSDeveloperProgram.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEaQx2NKzdYCnzgztInbpXJvdPHOQ">Instructions for enrolling in the iOS Developer Program</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Add the login information for your iOS Developer account to your Authorly account. You can do this through the Authorly interface. This gives our software developers and testers permission to manage and test the code for your app. We have a slew of iOS devices (iPhones, iPods, iPads) that are already provisioned for development by Apple.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upload promotional assets for your app through the Authorly interface. Apple requires a name, a description, several icons, screenshots, and contact information. Find out more about capturing these assets in Apple's official guide: <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Flibrary%2Fios%2F%23documentation%2FToolsLanguages%2FConceptual%2FYourFirstAppStoreSubmission%2FCreateYourAppRecordiniTunesConnect%2FCreateYourAppRecordiniTunesConnect.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLagTDDvjct9l9D_qIdDr0tDo4Aw">Creating Your App Record in iTunes Connect</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the Authorly team will submit your app through your iOS Developer account. Because the account is yours, Apple will contact you directly about the app if necessary.
			</p>
			<h3>What do I need to submit my app to Google Play?</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/v2/signup/">Sign up for a Google Play Developer Console account.</a> This costs $25 and requires a Google account. We recommend signing up for an entirely new Google account at the same time, because the Authorly team will need your login credentials to submit your Android app.
			</p>
			<p>
				Add the login information for your Google Play Developer Console account to your Authorly account. This gives our software developers and testers permission to manage and test the code for your app. We have Android phones and tablets prepared for this purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upload promotional assets for your app through the Authorly interface. Google requires a title, a description, cryptographic keys, two screenshots, promotional text, contact information, and a high-resolution icon. You can also include a promotional graphic, a feature graphic, a video link, and an end-license user agreement. Find out more about capturing these assets in Google's official guides: <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/preparing.html">Preparing for Release</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/1078870">Graphic Assets for your Application</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the Authorly team will submit your app through your Google Play Developer Console account. Because the account is yours, Google will contact you directly about the app if necessary.
			</p>
			<h3>What do I need to submit my app to the Kindle Fire Store?</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/welcome.html">Create a developer account on Amazon.com.</a> This is linked to a regular Amazon customer account. We recommend signing up for an entirely new Amazon account, because the Authorly team will need your login credentials to submit your app to the Kindle Fire Store.
			</p>
			<p>
				Add the login information for your Amazon developer account to your Authorly account. This gives our software developers and testers permission to manage and test the code for your app. We have the Amazon Mobile App SDK and Kindle Fire devices prepared for this purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upload promotional assets for your app through the Authorly interface. Amazon requires a small icon, a large icon, a title, a description, and screenshots. You can also include a promotional image (recommended) and videos. Amazon has provided several detailed guides and blog posts to help you to capture effective assets for marketing:<br />
				<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/fire/cx-guidelines.html#IconSizes">Kindle Fire User Experience Guidelines - Icon Sizes</a><br />
				<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/fire/marketing.html">Develop Your Marketing Strategy</a><br />

				<a href="http://www.amazonappstoredev.com/2012/08/submitting-visual-marketing-assets-marketing-tip-of-the-day-4.html">Submitting Visual Marketing Assets</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the Authorly team will submit your app through your Amazon developer account. Because the account is yours, Amazon will contact you directly about the app if necessary.
			</p>
			<h3>How do I check how much money Iâ€™ve made?</h3>
			<p>
			For the App Store, log into <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/">your iTunes Connect account</a>.<br />
			For Google Play, log into your <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/v2/">Google Play Developer Console</a>, and visit Financial Reports. Read more at Google's Android Developer guide: <a href="http://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2482017?hl=en">Sales and payout reports</a><br />

			</p>
			<h3>How do I get paid from sales of my app?</h3>
			<p>
			You're paid directly by Amazon, Google, and Apple.
			</p>
			<h3>Do you take any of the money?</h3>
			<p>
			No! The app is 100% yours.
			</p>
			<h3>Once I create and submit my app, will I still have access to it for editing? What if I want to make changes later?</h3>
			<p>
			Yes. You can edit the app in Authorly and resubmit it through us.
			</p>
			<p class="faq_backTop"><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>
		</article>
		<article class="faq ornament_ending">
			<h2>Device compatibility</h2>
			<h3>Will my app work on the [enter device name here]?</h3>
			<p>
				We don't guarantee that your app will work on every mobile device ever made, but if the device is standardized and reasonably modern, yes!
			</p>
			<h3>How do you ensure that my app works on all these different devices?</h3>
			<p>
				Our software development and quality assurance teams review and test your app on a variety of iOS and Android devices before submitting it to Google Play, the App Store, and the Kindle Fire Store.
			</p>
			<h3>Does Authorly build HTML5 or native apps?</h3>
			<p>
				Native apps. We have a lot of respect for HTML5, but native iOS and Android technologies ensure that your digital storybook is as smooth and polished as possible (and can be read offline!).
