			Authorly Terms of Service
		</h1>
		<p class="upDate">
			 Updated On: 1/28/2013
		</p>
		<p>
			Authorly ("we" or "us") provides a platform to enable you to create mobile and tablet applications (each a “Mobile Application”) and related hosting and support services (the "Service"). By choosing to use the <a href="http://www.authorly.com" target="_blank">www.Authorly.com</a> (or “<a href="http://www.author.ly" target="_blank">www.Author.ly</a>”) web site ("Site") and/or the Service, you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service").
		</p>
		<p>
			We reserve the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without advance notice. If we modify these Terms of Service,  then we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. By continuing to access or use the Site and Service after we have posted a modification to these Terms of Service on the Site or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms of Service. If the modified Terms of Service are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site and Service. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: <a href="http://www.authorly.com" target="_blank">www.authorly.com</a>. Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. You agree to use the Service at your own risk and subject to the terms set forth below.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Account Terms
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				You must be 13 years or older to use this Service and open an account ("Account").
			</li>
			<li>
				You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
			</li>
			<li>
				You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process to open an Account.</li>
			<li>
				You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. Authorly cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Authorly will be the sole publisher of your Mobile Applications with any mobile platform provider including, but not limited to, for the Android Market, but excluding Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple"). Such mobile platform providers are referred to in these Terms of Service as "Providers" and you may not use your own Account to publish a Mobile Application with any such Providers. As noted above, Apple is not considered a Provider under these Terms of Service and consequently, if you use the Service to develop a Mobile Application for the platforms and operating systems for the mobile devices of Apple then you must enter into a separate agreement with Apple directly in this regard to become an Apple application developer and you and not Authorly will be the publisher of your Mobile Applications for Apple mobile devices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree, to provide Authorly with full access to the account you create with Apple by providing Authorly with your Apple account login details (e.g. email address/password) so that we may (i) initially publish your Apple Mobile Application, (ii) upgrade your Apple Mobile Applications when Authorly has new releases of the Service, and (iii) track all revenue by you relating to such Apple Mobile Application and account for such revenues in the context of the Service.
			</li>
			<li>
				Except for Site Advertisements (defined below), you are responsible for all text, data, graphics, images, photos and video files posted on the Site or via the Service ("Content") and activity that occurs under your Account (even when Content is posted by others who have access to your Account). Your content includes any advertisements sourced and/or made available by you via your paid Mobile Offerings.
			</li>
			<li>
				You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright and privacy laws).
			</li>
			<li>
				See our Privacy Policy for information and notices concerning Authorly’s collection and use of your personal information and that of end users.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>
			Payments &amp; Refund Terms
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Except in connection with a Trial Period or a free feature of the Service, a valid credit card is required.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Service is billed in advance and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for setup fees, partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account. You must provide 72 hours notice before your billing anniversary date in order to insure no additional billing for the following year. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

			</li>
			<li>
				Authorly will use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Mobile Application approved by the applicable Providers. Although there is a high likelihood of approval, we do not and cannot guarantee acceptance. If your Mobile Application is denied by the appropriate Provider, you may cancel your Account. However, there are no refunds under any circumstances.
			</li>
			<li>
				If invoiced, payment is due upon receipt.
			</li>
		</ol>

			</li>
			<li>

We will remit to you the remainder amount of such Application Sales Revenue and In-Application Revenue within thirty (30) days of our receipt of the Provider’s payment thereof. 
			</li>
			<li>
				If you decide to sell any digital media (including music, videos or other content) through the Mobile Application by using iTunes, Amazon, or 7digital ("Stores"), you may only use straight links to the Stores (i.e., you are not allowed to use any affiliate links). You acknowledge and agree that Authorly may use affiliate links to the Stores and retain 100% of the applicable affiliate revenue. You may use affiliate links to any other store, other than the Stores, through which you sell your Mobile Application.
			</li>
		</ol>

Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account.

		</p>
		<h2>
			Dispute Resolution
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				You and Authorly agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site, Services or Offering (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Authorly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Furthermore, unless both you and Authorly otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Service.
			</li>
			<li>
				Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med" target="_blank">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
			</li>
			<li>
				Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314" target="_blank">http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
			</li>
			<li>
				Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Authorly otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and  Authorly submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
			</li>
			<li>
				Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Authorly will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Authorly will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
			</li>
			<li>
				Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if Authorly changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by contacting us at  <a href="mailto:info@authorly.com">info@authorly.com</a>)  within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated Date" above or in the date of Authorly’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Authorly in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>
			General
		</h2>
		<p>

The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and Authorly and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Authorly (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Service invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Service with remain in full force and effect.
